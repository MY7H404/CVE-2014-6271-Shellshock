# Shellshock Exploit (CVE-2014-6271)

## Description
The Shellshock Exploit is a tool designed to efficiently exploit the Shellshock vulnerability (CVE-2014-6271) in susceptible CGI servers, enabling a precise takeover of the target server. Shellshock is a critical security vulnerability that affects the Bash shell, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the targeted system.

## Key Features
- **Exploit Automation:** Automates the exploitation of the Shellshock vulnerability in CGI scripts, streamlining the process for penetration testing and security research.
- **Reverse Shell Connectivity:** Provides options for establishing a reverse shell connection to the target server, supporting various methods such as Netcat (nc), TCP, and PHP.
- **Customizable Options:** Allows users to specify the target host, CGI script, remote host for the reverse shell, port, and preferred shell method through command-line options.

## CVE Information
- CVE Number: [CVE-2014-6271](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6271)
- CVE Description: Bash through 4.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via crafted environment variables passed to Bash scripts.

## How it Works

1. **Identification of Vulnerable CGI Scripts:**
   - The tool scans the specified host for potential CGI scripts that may be susceptible to the Shellshock vulnerability.

2. **Crafting Malicious Environment Variables:**
   - Once vulnerable CGI scripts are identified, the tool generates specially crafted environment variables containing malicious commands.

3. **Exploiting Shellshock Vulnerability:**
   - The crafted environment variables are injected into the CGI scripts, taking advantage of the Shellshock vulnerability in the Bash shell.

4. **Reverse Shell Connection:**
   - The tool establishes a reverse shell connection to the specified remote host and port, providing the user with interactive access to the target system.

5. **User Interaction and Control:**
   - The user can interact with the target system through the established reverse shell connection, allowing for further exploitation or analysis.
